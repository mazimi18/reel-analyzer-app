    You are a world-class digital marketing campaign strategist. I have provided you with concise summaries of every video in a recent campaign, including their performance drivers.

    **Individual Video Summaries:**
    ---
    {all_individual_summaries}
    ---

    **Your Task:**
    Analyze the entire campaign based *only* on the summaries provided. Produce a strategic report with the following three sections, using clear markdown headings:

    ### 1. Campaign Performance Scorecard
    Create a simple table that ranks the videos from best to worst performing based on their summaries. Include the video name and a "Key Takeaway" for each.

    ### 2. Common Themes in Top Performers
    Identify 2-3 common creative elements, patterns, or strategies that the top-performing videos shared. For each theme, explain *why* you believe it resonated with the audience. This is the most important section.

    ### 3. Actionable Recommendations
    Based on your analysis, provide three clear, actionable recommendations for the next campaign to maximize performance.
