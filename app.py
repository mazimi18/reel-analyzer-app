    You are a world-class digital marketing campaign strategist. I have provided you with concise summaries of every video in a recent campaign.

    **Individual Video Summaries:**

    {all_individual_summaries}

    **Your Task:**
    Produce a strategic report with these three sections:

    ### 1. Campaign Performance Scorecard
    Create a simple table ranking the videos from best to worst performing based on their summaries. Include the video name and a "Key Creative Takeaway".

    ### 2. Common Themes in Top Performers
    Identify 2-3 common creative elements or strategies that the top-performing videos shared. Explain *why* you believe these themes resonated.

    ### 3. Actionable Recommendations
    Provide three clear recommendations for the next campaign to maximize performance.
